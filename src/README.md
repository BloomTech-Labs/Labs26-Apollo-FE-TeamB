## Components
Instructions for working with application components

##### Topic Creation
- Button and Modal component from the 'antd' library - other 'antd' components used - (Menu, Form, Select, Input)
- Modal has multiple different steps, taking the user through the topic creation process and the input fields conditionally render depending on the current step
- There is some validation in place, but that still needs to be worked on (can't go to next modal step until you fill out the current step)
- The variable [currentTopic] is where state lives when going through the creation process
```javascript
currentTopic = {
    id: 'possibly generated by backend?',
    contextId: 'id of whatever the chosen context is',
    contextName: 'name of chosen context e.g. - "Product Leadership"',
    name: 'the name that the creator chooses',
    frequency: 'chosen frequency e.g. - "Monthly"',
    // array of leader question objects e.g.
    leaderQuestions: [
        {
            id: 'question id',
            type: 'question type, e.g. - "text"',
            body: 'question body'
        }
    ],
    //array of member question objects e.g.
    memberQuestions: [
        {
            id: 'question id',
            type: 'question type, e.g. - "text"',
            body: 'question body'
        }
    ]
};
```
- Added state management for each step to update this local state object
- Current submit button just has a placeholder response, but will later be changed out for an api call
- There are currently some hard coded values such as default question lists and context types, but these can be changed out for an api call if needed
