// import all of your reducers into this file, and export them back out.
// This allows for the simplification of flow when importing reducers into your actions throughout your app.

import { combineReducers } from 'redux';

// example
// --------------------------------------
// import {fooReducer as foo} from './fooReducer'

// const reducer = combineReducers({foo});

// export default reducer
